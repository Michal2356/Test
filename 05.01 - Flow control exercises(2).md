# Flow control exercises

### Exercise 1

Write code that:
- prints `Hello` if `1` is stored in `spam` variable,
- prints `Howdy` if `2` is stored in `spam`,
- and prints `Greetings!` if anything else is stored in `spam`.


```python
# Code here
spam = 3
if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings')
    
    
```

    Greetings


### Exercise 2

Write a program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number.

For example, if the user entered `10` the output should be `55` (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10).

Expected output:
```
Enter your number.
10
Sum is: 55
```


```python
# Code here
print("Enter your number.")
n = int(input())

sum = 0

for num in range(1, n + 1):
    sum = sum + num

print("Sum is: ", sum)
```

    Enter your number.
    10
    Sum is:  55


### Exercise 3

Write a program to print the following number pattern using a loop, where number of rows is given by the user.

Expected output:
```
How many rows would you like to draw?
5

1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 2 3
1 2
1
```


```python
# Code here
print("How many rows would you like to draw")
rows = int(input())
print('\r')


for i in range(rows, 0, -1):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(j, end=' ')
    print('\r')
    
```

    How many rows would you like to draw
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5 
    1 2 3 4 
    1 2 3 
    1 2 
    1 


### Exercise 4

Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

- At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
- At least 1 number between [0-9].
- At least 1 character from [$#@].
- Minimum length 6 characters.
- Maximum length 16 characters.

Expected output:
```
What is your password?
MarekTracz1
Invalid password format.
```
or:
```
What is your password?
M@r3kTracz
Registration successful.
```


```python
# Code here
import re
print("What is your password?")
p = input()
x = True
while x:  
    if (len(p)<6 or len(p)>12):
        break
    elif not re.search("[a-z]",p):
        break
    elif not re.search("[0-9]",p):
        break
    elif not re.search("[A-Z]",p):
        break
    elif not re.search("[$#@]",p):
        break
    else:
        print("Registration successful")
        x=False
        break

if x:
    print("Invalid password format.")

```

    What is your password?
    M@r3kTracz
    Registration successful


### Exercise 5

Write a program that reads two inputs representing a month and day and prints the season for that month and day.

Expected output:
```
Input the month (e.g. January, February, etc.):
December
Input the day:
1
At that day, the season is autumn.
```


```python
# Code here
print("Input the month (e.g. January, February etc.): ")
month = input()
print("Input the day: ")
day = int(input())

if month in ('January', 'February', 'March'):
    season = 'winter'
elif month in ('April', 'May', 'June'):
    season = 'spring'
elif month in ('July', 'August', 'September'):
    season = 'summer'
else:
    season = 'autumn'

if (month == 'March') and (day > 20):
    season = 'spring'
elif (month == 'June') and (day > 21):
    season = 'summer'
elif (month == 'September') and (day > 22):
    season = 'autumn'
elif (month == 'December') and (day > 21):
    season = 'winter'

print("At that day, the season is",season)
```

    Input the month (e.g. January, February etc.): 
    December
    Input the day: 
    1
    At that day, the season is autumn


### Exercise 6

Given a dictionary called `stocks` that contains both stock tickers and the corresponding stock prices, write code that prints out the formatted information in the table.

Expected output:
```
-----------------------
TICKER      PRICE (USD)
-----------------------
AAPL             165.30
MSFT             330.59
FB               324.46
AMZN            3507.07
TSLA            1144.76
GOOGL           2837.95
```


```python
stocks = {
        'AAPL': 165.30,
        'MSFT': 330.59,
        'FB': 324.46,
        'AMZN': 3507.07,
        'TSLA': 1144.76,
        'GOOGL': 2837.95
        }

# Code here
print('-----------------------')
print('TICKER      PRICE (USD)')
print('-----------------------')

for key, value in stocks.items() :
    print('{0:<8}      {1:>9}'.format(key, str(value)))
 
```

    -----------------------
    TICKER      PRICE (USD)
    -----------------------
    AAPL              165.3
    MSFT             330.59
    FB               324.46
    AMZN            3507.07
    TSLA            1144.76
    GOOGL           2837.95


### Exercise 7

The code below prints all perfect numbers from 1 to 100. Rewrite the `while` loop into `for` loop.

More information about perfect numbers here: [Wikipedia: Perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number).


```python
# solution using while and for loops

print('Shows Perfect number fom 1 to 100.')
n = 2
# outer while loop
while n <= 100:
    x_sum = 0
    # inner for loop
    for i in range(1, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            x_sum += i
    if x_sum == n:
        print('Perfect number:', n)
    n += 1
```

    Shows Perfect number fom 1 to 100.
    Perfect number: 6
    Perfect number: 28



```python
# solution using only for loops
print('Shows Perfect number fom 1 to 100.')
n = 2
# outer while loop
for n in range(100):
    x_sum = 0
    if n < 1:
        continue
    # inner for loop
    for i in range(1, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            x_sum += i
    if x_sum == n:
        print('Perfect number:', n)
    n += 1
```

    Shows Perfect number fom 1 to 100.
    Perfect number: 6
    Perfect number: 28



```python

```
